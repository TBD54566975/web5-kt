This repo contains 4 jvm packages:

* [common](./common) - utilities for encoding, decoding, and hashing
* [crypto](./crypto) - key generation, signing, signature verification, encryption, and decryption
* [dids](./dids) - did generation and resolution
* [credentials](./credentials) - creation and verification of verifiable claims

# Quickstart

You can add this library to your project using Gradle or Maven. There are two ways to do so. The first is pulling the
package from Maven Central. The second is pulling the package from JitPack.

## Maven Central

When pulling from Maven Central, you can pull the entire library or just a single module. Examples of both are shown
below. Please note that you need to add the repositories shown below to your `build.gradle.kts` file. This is because
the libraries that we depend on are hosted in separate places.

```kt
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven("https://jitpack.io")
  maven("https://repo.danubetech.com/repository/maven-public/")
  maven("https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/thirdparty-releases/")
}
  
dependencies {
  // If you want to pull the entire library
  implementation("xyz.block:web5:0.1.0")
  
  // If you want to pull a single module
  implementation("xyz.block:web5-common:0.1.0")
  implementation("xyz.block:web5-credentials:0.1.0")
  implementation("xyz.block:web5-crypto:0.1.0")
  implementation("xyz.block:web5-dids:0.1.0")
}
```

## JitPack

You can also pull the jars for this library from [JitPack](https://jitpack.io). To start simply add the following to your
`build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven("https://jitpack.io")
  maven("https://repo.danubetech.com/repository/maven-public/")
  maven("https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/thirdparty-releases/")
}

dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.TBD54566975:web5-kt:main-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The repository at `https://repo.danubetech.com/repository/maven-public/` is required for resolving transitive
dependencies.

If you want to refer to a specific release, then replace the `main-SNAPSHOT` with release tag.

If you want to pull a PR, then replace `main-SNAPSHOT` using the template `PR<NR>-SNAPSHOT`. For
example `PR40-SNAPSHOT`.

If you want to depend on a single module, like `credentials`, then use the following dependencies

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.github.TBD54566975.web5-kt:credentials:master-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

# Examples

Examples are hosted in the public documentation for each module, which is hosted
in [GitHub Pages](https://tbd54566975.github.io/web5-kt/docs/htmlMultiModule/credentials/index.html).

# Development

## Prerequisites

Install java version 11. If you're installing a higher version, it must be compatible with Gradle 8.2.

If you want to have multiple version of Java installed in your machine, we recommend using [jenv](https://www.jenv.be/).

> [!NOTE]: Restart your shell after installation.

## Build

To build and run test just run:

```bash
./gradlew build --console=rich
```

## Releasing

In order to release to Central Repository, simply cut a new release tag in the Github UI. There is a configured [Github
Action](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) that will automatically publish the release to Central Repository. You can cut
the release by going to the [create a new releases page](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-kt/releases/new). When
creating a new tag, the name should be in the format `vX.Y.Z`. Please note that once a release is made, it is immutable
and cannot be deleted.

### Manual Release

If you want to do a manual release, you have two options:
1. Dispatch the [publish workflow](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) workflow from the Github UI. Go to the [publish 
   Actions](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-kt/actions) > "Run workflow". 
2. Setup your local environment to publish to Central Repository. This is more involved. You'll need to:
   1. Define all the environment variables described in the [publish workflow](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) file. You
      can find the values in the [secrets and variable](https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-kt/settings/secrets/actions)
      page.
   2. Run the following command (you can change `samplebranch` to any branch name):
      ```bash
      ./gradlew -Pversion=samplebranch-SNAPSHOT publishToSonatype closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository
      ```
