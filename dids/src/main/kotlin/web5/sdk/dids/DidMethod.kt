/**
 * A base abstraction for Decentralized Identifiers (DID) compliant with the W3C DID standard.
 *
 * This abstract class serves as a foundational structure upon which specific DID methods
 * can be implemented. Subclasses should furnish particular method and data models adherent
 * to various DID methods.
 *
 * @property uri The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) string of the DID.
 * @property keyManager An [KeyManager] instance managing the cryptographic keys linked to the DID.
 *
 * ### Example Implementation
 * Implementing subclasses should provide concrete method and data models specific to a DID method:
 * ```
 * class SpecificDid(uri: String, keyManager: KeyManager): Did(uri, keyManager) {
 *     // Implementation-specific details here.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Additional Notes
 * Implementers should adhere to the respective DID method specifications ensuring both compliance
 * and interoperability across different DID networks.

/**
 * An interface defining operations for DID methods in accordance with the W3C DID standard.
 *
 * A DID method is a specific set of rules for creating, updating, and revoking DIDs,
 * specified in a DID method specification. Different DID methods utilize different
 * consensus mechanisms, cryptographic algorithms, and registries (or none at all).
 * The purpose of `DidMethod` implementations is to provide logic tailored to a
 * particular method while adhering to the broader operations outlined in the W3C DID standard.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface should provide method-specific logic for
 * creating and resolving DIDs under a particular method.
 *
 * @param T The type of DID that this method can create and resolve, extending [Did].
 *
 * ### Example of a Custom DID Method Implementation:
 * ```
 * class ExampleDidMethod : DidMethod<ExampleDid, ExampleCreateDidOptions> {
 *     override val methodName: String = "example"
 *
 *     override fun create(keyManager: KeyManager, options: ExampleCreateDidOptions?): ExampleDid {
 *         // Implementation-specific logic for creating DIDs.
 *     }
 *
 *     override fun resolve(didUrl: String, opts: ResolveDidOpts?): DidResolutionResult {
 *         // Implementation-specific logic for resolving DIDs.
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Notes:
 * - Ensure conformance with the relevant DID method specification for accurate and
 *   interoperable functionality.
 * - Ensure that cryptographic operations utilize secure and tested libraries, ensuring
 *   the reliability and security of DIDs managed by this method.
