 * Represents options during the creation of a Decentralized Identifier (DID).

 * ### Usage Example:
 * Implement this interface in classes where specific creation options are needed
 * for different DID methods.
 *
 * ```
 * class MyDidCreationOptions : CreateDidOptions {
 *     // Implementation-specific options for DID creation.
 * }

 * verified in a decentralized manner, commonly via blockchain technology.
 *
 * @property keyManager Reference to a [KeyManager] instance to manage cryptographic keys related to this DID.
 * @property uri The string representation of the DID in URI format.

 * ### Example Usage:
 * ```
 * val myDid = Did(myKeyManager, "did:example:123456789abcdefghi")

 * Defines the contract for DID methods, facilitating creation and resolution of DIDs.

 * ### Usage Example:
 * Implement this interface in classes that facilitate a specific method of handling DIDs on
 * particular blockchains or networks.
