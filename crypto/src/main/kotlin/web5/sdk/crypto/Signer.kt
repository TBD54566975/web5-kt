 * ### Usage Example:
 * Implement this interface in classes where specific signing options need to
 * be configured and passed to signing methods.
 *
 * ```
 * class MySignOptions : SignOptions {
 *     // Implementation-specific options for signing.

/**
 * An interface defining the contract for signing and verifying signatures on payloads.
 *
 * `Signer` provides a generic approach to:
 * - Creating digital signatures on payloads ([sign])
 * - Verifying digital signatures ([verify])
 *
 * Implementers of this interface should ensure mechanisms provided for
 * signing and verifying respect the cryptographic standards necessary for
 * secure and valid operations.
 *
 * ### Usage Example:
 * ```
 * class MySigner : Signer {
 *     override fun sign(privateKey: JWK, payload: Payload, options: SignOptions?): String {
 *         // Implementation-specific signing logic.
 *     }
 *
 *     override fun verify(publicKey: JWK, jws: String, options: VerifyOptions?) {
 *         // Implementation-specific verification logic.
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Implementers may utilize [SignOptions] and [VerifyOptions] to allow
 * consumers to pass in additional, implementation-specific options
 * to influence the signing and verification processes respectively.
 *
 * @see SignOptions for options during signing.
 * @see VerifyOptions for options during signature verification.
